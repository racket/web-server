  The web server can avoid storing uploaded files in memory.
  In particular, a @tech[#:doc '(lib "web-server/scribblings/web-server-internal.scrbl")]{
   safety limits} value can instruct this
  library to offload files to disk if they are larger than some threshold.
  Even for file uploads that are not written to disk,
  the web server initially places the content in an input port,
  rather than a byte-string, so that storage need not be retained
  after the content has been read.

  The port-based interface is exposed to programmers,
  and it can be significantly more memory efficient than
  the byte-string--based interface.
  However, the port-based interface is stateful:
  programmers who use it take responsibility for managing the state
  of the input port.
  Read on for details.

  To maintain compatability, the port-based interface uses a private,
  opaque subtype of @racket[binding:file].
  Instances of this extended type are recognized by the predicate
  @racket[binding:file/port?] and are created using
  @racket[make-binding:file/port], which is like @racket[make-binding:file],
  but takes the file content as an input port rather than a byte string.
  Only @racket[binding:file] instances recognized by @racket[binding:file/port?]
  support @racket[binding:file/port-in].
  The web server uses @racket[make-binding:file/port] when reading
  @racket[request] structures, which is the primary way most programs
  encounter @racket[binding:file] instances:
  however, deserialized instances (see below) and instances constructed
  manually using @racket[make-binding:file] do not support the port-based API.

  It is important to be aware of how @racket[binding:file-content]
  works with port-based instances.
  The first time @racket[binding:file-content] is called on a
  port-based instance @racket[v], it consumes the port's remaining content
  as with @racket[(port->bytes (binding:file/port-in v))],
  memoizes the result for future calls to @racket[binding:file-content],
  and closes the input port.
  This behavior means that:
  @itemlist[
 @item{A given byte of input may be either stored in the
    @racket[binding:file-content] field or read directly by
    from the input port, but never both; and
   }
 @item{If the input port has already been closed directly
    when @racket[binding:file-content] is called for the first time,
    @racket[binding:file-content] will raise an exception.
    }]

  Accessing the @racket[binding:file-content] field indirectly,
  such as by using @racket[match], has the same behavior as calling
  @racket[binding:file-content] directly.
  In particular, calling @racket[serialize] on a @racket[binding:file]
  instance implicitly uses @racket[binding:file-content],
  and deserialized instances are effectively constructed using
  @racket[make-binding:file].

These functions, while convenient, could introduce subtle errors into your
application. Examples: that they are case-insensitive could introduce
an error; if the data submitted is not in UTF-8 format, then the conversion
to a string will fail; if an attacker submits a form field as if it were
a file, when it is not, then the @racket[request-bindings] will hold a
@racket[bytes?] object and your program will error; and, for file uploads
you lose the filename. @bold{Therefore, we recommend against their use, but

An HTTP response where @racket[output] produces the body by writing to
the output port. @racket[code] is the response code, @racket[message]
the message, @racket[seconds] the generation time, @racket[mime] the
MIME type of the file, and @racket[headers] are the headers.

If @racket[headers] does not include @litchar{Date},
@litchar{Last-Modified}, or @litchar{Server} headers, then the server
will automatically add them, where @litchar{Date} is based on
@racket[current-seconds], @litchar{Last-Modified} is based on
@racket[seconds], and @litchar{Server} is @litchar{Racket}.

If @racket[headers] does not include @litchar{Content-Type} and
@racket[mime] is not @racket[#f], then @racket[mime] is added as a
@litchar{Content-Type} header.

The server will always replace your @litchar{Connection} header if it
needs to ensure the connection will be closed. (Typically with an
HTTP/1.0 client.)

The server will always puts headers it generates before those in the
@racket[response] structure and guarantees that the headers supplied
appear in the output in the order given. (This is relevant if multiple
occurrences of the same header have a different interpretation by the
client, such as with @litchar{Set-Cookie}.)

 @racketblock[
  (response

@section[#:tag "id-cookie"]{Authenticated Cookies}

@(require (for-label web-server/http/id-cookie))
@defmodule[web-server/http/id-cookie]{

Cookies are useful for storing information of user's browsers and
particularly useful for storing identifying information for
authentication, sessions, etc. However, there are inherent
difficulties when using cookies as authenticators, because cookie data
is fully controlled by the user, and thus cannot be trusted.

This module provides functions for creating and verifying
authenticated cookies that are intrinsically timestamped. It is based
on the algorithm proposed by the
@link["https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/cookies/"]{MIT Cookie Eaters}: if you store
the data @racket[_data] at time @racket[_authored-seconds], then the
user will receive @litchar{digest&authored-seconds&data}, where
@racket[_digest] is an HMAC-SHA1 digest of @racket[_authored-seconds]
and @racket[_data], using an arbitrary secret key. When you receive a
cookie, it will reverify this digest and check that the cookie's
@racket[_authored-seconds] is not after a timeout period, and only
then return the cookie data to the program.

The interface represents the secret key as a byte string.
@bold{For security, this should be created using cryptographic-quality randomness.}
A convenient purely Racket-based option is @racket[make-secret-salt/file],
which is implemented using @racket[crypto-random-bytes].
You can also generate random bytes using something like OpenSSL or @tt{/dev/random}:
 @link["https://www.madboa.com/geek/openssl/#random-data"]{this FAQ} lists a few options.

  Generates a cookie named @racket[name] that is not validly authenticated

  This will cause non-malicious browsers to overwrite a previously set
  cookie. If you use authenticated cookies for login information, you
  could send this to cause a ``logout.'' However, malicious browsers do
  not need to respect such an overwrite. Therefore, this is not an
  effective way to implement timeouts or protect users on
  public (i.e. possibly compromised) computers. The only way to securely
  logout on the compromised computer is to have server-side state
  keeping track of which cookies (sessions, etc.) are invalid. Depending
  on your application, it may be better to track live sessions or dead
  sessions, or never set cookies to begin with and just use
  (stateful) continuations, which you can revoke with @racket[send/finish].

   @defthing[permanently redirection-status?])]{
  The function @racket[redirect-to]
  generates an HTTP response that redirects the browser to @racket[uri],
  while including the @racket[headers] in the response.
  The @racket[status] argument is a @deftech{redirection status}
  value, which determines the specific type of HTTP redirect to be used.

  The default @tech{redirection status}, @racket[temporarily],
  is preserved for backwards compatibility:
  new code should usually use either @racket[temporarily/same-method]
  or @racket[see-other], instead.
  The @racket[temporarily] @tech{redirection status} corresponds to
  @hyperlink["https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.3"]{
   @litchar{302 Found}}.
  Unfortunately, browsers have not implemented this status consistently
  for methods other than @litchar{GET} and (in practice, with all but some
  very old browsers) @litchar{POST}.

  The @racket[temporarily/same-method] @tech{redirection status}
  uses @hyperlink["https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.7"]{
   @litchar{307 Temporary Redirect}}.
  This redirects the browser to @racket[uri] using the same HTTP method
  as the original request.

  The @racket[see-other] @tech{redirection status} corresponds to
  @hyperlink["https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.4"]{
   @litchar{303 See Other}}.
  It is most often used to implement the @deftech{Post-Redirect-Get}
  pattern: as a response to a request using @litchar{POST} or
  another HTTP method with side-effects, it causes the browser to
  perform a @litchar{GET} or @litchar{HEAD} request for @racket[uri],
  which gives a response to the original @litchar{POST} request.
  This prevents the @onscreen{Back} and @onscreen{Refresh} buttons
  from duplicating effects, such as making a purchase or
  adding items to a database.
  The web server provides @racket[redirect/get] for added convenience
  with @tech{Post-Redirect-Get}.

  The @racket[permanently] @tech{redirection status} uses the HTTP status
  @hyperlink["https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.2"]{
   @litchar{301 Moved Permanently}}.
  It is like @racket[temporarily], except that, as the name suggests,
  it signifies that the move is permanent and that search engines,
  for example, should use @racket[uri] instead of the URI of the
  original request.
  Unfortunately, @racket[permanently] is also like @racket[temporarily]
  in that browsers have implemented it inconsistently for
  methods other than @litchar{GET} and @litchar{HEAD}:
  in particular, @hyperlink["https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.2"]{
   RFC 7231} permits that, ``for historical reasons, a user agent @bold{may}
  change the request method from @litchar{POST} to @litchar{GET} for the subsequent request.
  When it is important to ensure that the request to @racket[uri] use the same method,
  there are some possible alternatives:
  @itemlist[
 @item{RFC 7231 suggests using @litchar{307 Temporary Redirect},
    i.e. @racket[temporarily/same-method].
    This has the disadvantage that search engines and others won't
    update references to the old URI.}
 @item{@hyperlink["https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7538"]{RFC 7538}
    specifies a new HTTP status, @litchar{308 Permanent Redirect},
    which forbids changing the request method, analogously to
    @litchar{307 Temporary Redirect}.
    However, the RFC also highlights some important
    @hyperlink["https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7538#section-4"]{
     deployment considerations} for this status.
    In particular, older browsers---including, as of this writing,
    some that remain in
    @hyperlink["https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/308#Browser_compatibility"]{
     relatively common use}---do not understand this status and will
    fall back to the semantics of
    @hyperlink["https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.1"]{
     @litchar{300 Multiple Choices}}, which is often undesirable.}
 @item{The application can note the method of the original request
    and use @racket[permanently] for @litchar{GET} and @litchar{HEAD} requests
    or one of the other alternatives for other methods.}]

 This is a viable function to pass to @racket[set-any->response!].

 See the documentation for @racket[response/full] to see how @racket[#f] is handled for @racket[message].

JSON is a widely used data format for the web. Racket's JSON
library meets the web server with @racket[response/jsexpr],
which is for JSON what @racket[response/xexpr] is for XML.

  code message seconds mime-type

 See the documentation for @racket[response/full] to see how @racket[message], if @racket[#f], is turned into a @racket[bytes?].
