@title[#:tag "formlets"]{Formlets: Functional Form Abstraction}

@defmodule[web-server/formlets]

The @web-server provides a kind of Web form abstraction called a @tech{formlet}.

@margin-note{@tech{Formlet}s originate in the work of the @link["http://links-lang.org"]{Links} research group in
their paper @link["http://links-lang.org/papers/formlets-essence.pdf"]{The Essence of Form Abstraction}.}

@section{Basic Formlet Usage}

Suppose we want to create an abstraction of entering a date in an HTML form. The following
@deftech{formlet} captures this idea:

@racketblock[
(define date-formlet
  (formlet
   (div "Month:" ,{input-int . => . month}
        "Day:" ,{input-int . => . day})
   (list month day)))
]

The first part of the @racket[formlet] syntax is the template of an @xexpr that is the rendering
of the formlet. It can contain elements like @racket[,(_formlet . => . _name)] where @racket[_formlet]
is a formlet expression and @racket[_name] is an identifier bound in the second part of the @racket[formlet]
syntax.

This formlet is displayed (with @racket[formlet-display]) as the following @xexpr forest (list):

@racketblock[
(list 
 '(div "Month:" (input ([name "input_0"]))
       "Day:" (input ([name "input_1"]))))
]

@racket[date-formlet] not only captures the rendering of the form, but also the request processing
logic. If we send it an HTTP request with bindings for @racket["input_0"] to @racket["10"] and
@racket["input_1"] to @racket["3"], with @racket[formlet-process], then it returns:

@racketblock[
(list 10 3)
]

which is the second part of the @racket[formlet] syntax, where @racket[month] has been replaced with the
integer represented by the @racket["input_0"] and @racket[day] has been replaced with the
integer represented by the @racket["input_1"].

The real power of formlet is that they can be embedded within one another. For instance, suppose we want to
combine two date forms to capture a travel itinerary. The following formlet does the job:

@racketblock[
(define travel-formlet
  (formlet
   (div
    "Name:" ,{input-string . => . name}
    (div
     "Arrive:" ,{date-formlet . => . arrive}
     "Depart:" ,{date-formlet . => . depart})
   (list name arrive depart))))
]

(Notice that @racket[date-formlet] is embedded twice.) This is rendered as:

@racketblock[
(list 
 '(div
   "Name:"
   (input ([name "input_0"]))
   (div
    "Arrive:"
    (div "Month:" (input ([name "input_1"]))
         "Day:" (input ([name "input_2"])))
    "Depart:"
    (div "Month:" (input ([name "input_3"]))
         "Day:" (input ([name "input_4"]))))))
]

Observe that @racket[formlet-display] has automatically generated unique names for each input element. When we pass
bindings for these names to @racket[formlet-process], the following list is returned:

@racketblock[
(list "Jay"
      (list 10 3)
      (list 10 6))
]

In all these examples, we used the @racket[input-int] and
@racket[input-string] formlets. Any value with the @tech{formlet}
contract can be used in these positions. For example,
@racket[(to-string (required (text-input)))] could be used as
well. The rest of the manual gives the details of @tech{formlet}
usage, extension, and existing formlet combinators.

@section{Static Syntactic Shorthand}

@(require (for-label web-server/formlets/syntax))
@defmodule[web-server/formlets/syntax]{

Most users will want to use the syntactic shorthand for creating @tech{formlet}s.

@defform[(formlet rendering-xexpr yields-expr)]{
 Constructs a @tech{formlet} with the specified @racket[rendering-xexpr] and the processing
 result is the evaluation of the @racket[yields-expr] expression. The @racket[rendering-xexpr] form is a quasiquoted
 syntactic @xexpr, with three special caveats:
 
 @racket[,{_formlet-expr . => . _name}] embeds the
 @tech{formlet} given by @racket[_formlet-expr]; the result of processing this formlet is
 available in the @racket[yields-expr] as @racket[_name]. 
 
 @racket[,{_formlet-expr . => . (values _name ...)}] embeds the
 @tech{formlet} given by @racket[_formlet-expr]; the results of processing this formlet is
 available in the @racket[yields-expr] as @racket[_name ...]. 
 
 @racket[(#%# _xexpr ...)] renders an @xexpr forest.
 
 These forms @emph{may not} appear nested inside @racket[unquote] or @racket[unquote-splicing]. For example, this is illegal:
 @racketblock[
  (formlet (div ,@(for/list ([i (in-range 10)])
                    `(p ,((text-input) . => . name))))
           name)
  ]
}

@defidform[#%#]{Only allowed inside @racket[formlet] and @racket[formlet*].}

}

@section{Dynamic Syntactic Shorthand}

@(require (for-label web-server/formlets/dyn-syntax))
@defmodule[web-server/formlets/dyn-syntax]{

The @racket[formlet] syntax is too restrictive for some applications because it forces the @racket[_rendering]
to be @emph{syntactically} an @|xexpr|. You may discover you want to use a more "dynamic" shorthand.

@defform[(formlet* rendering-expr yields-expr)]{
 Constructs a @tech{formlet} where @racket[rendering-expr] is evaluated (with caveats) to construct the rendering
 and the processing result is the evaluation of the @racket[yields-expr] expression.
 The @racket[rendering-expr] should evaluate to an "@xexpr" that may embed the results of the following forms
 that only have meaning within @racket[formlet*]:
 
 @racket[{_formlet-expr . =>* . _name}] embeds the
 @tech{formlet} given by @racket[_formlet-expr]; the result of processing this formlet is
 available in the @racket[yields-expr] as @racket[_name]. 
 
 @racket[{_formlet-expr . =>* . (values _name ...)}] embeds the
 @tech{formlet} given by @racket[_formlet-expr]; the results of processing this formlet is
 available in the @racket[yields-expr] as @racket[_name ...]. 
 
 @racket[(#%# _xexpr-expr ...)] renders an @xexpr forest.
 
 Each of these forms evaluates to an opaque value that @racket[rendering-expr] may not manipulate in any way,
 but if it is returned to @racket[formlet*] as part of an "@xexpr" it will be rendered and the formlets processing
 stages will be executed, etc.
 
 Because these forms @emph{may} appear anywhere in @racket[rendering-expr], they may be duplicated. Therefore, 
 the formlet may render (and be processed) multiple times. Thus, in @racket[yields-expr] the formlet result names are
 bound to lists of results rather than single results as in @racket[formlet]. The result list is ordered according 
 to the order of the formlets in the result of @racket[rendering-expr]. For example, in 
 @racketblock[
  (formlet* `(div ,@(for/list ([i (in-range 1 10)])
                      `(p ,(number->string i)
                          ,((text-input) . =>* . name))))
            name)
  ]
 @racket[name] is bound to a list of strings, not a single string, where the first element is the string that
 was inputted next to the string @litchar{1} on the Web page.
 
 In this example, it is clear that this is the desired behavior. However, sometimes the value of a formlet's
 result may be surprising. For example, in
 @racketblock[
  (formlet* `(div (p ,((text-input) . =>* . name)))
            name)
  ]
 @racket[name] is bound to a list of strings, because @racket[formlet*] cannot syntactically determine if
 the formlet whose result is bound to @racket[name] is used many times.
 
}

@defidform[=>*]{Only allowed inside @racket[formlet*].}

}

@section{Functional Usage}

@(require (for-label web-server/formlets/lib))
@defmodule[web-server/formlets/lib]{

The syntactic shorthand abbreviates the construction of @tech{formlet}s with the following library.
These combinators may be used directly to construct low-level formlets, such as those for new INPUT element
types. Refer to @secref["input-formlets"] for example low-level formlets using these combinators.

@defthing[xexpr-forest/c contract?]{
 Equivalent to @racket[(listof xexpr/c)]
}

@defproc[(formlet/c [content contract?] ...) contract?]{
 Equivalent to @racket[(integer? . -> . 
            (values xexpr-forest/c
                    ((listof binding?) . -> . (values (coerce-contract 'formlet/c content) ...))
                    integer?))].

 A @tech{formlet}'s internal representation is a function from an initial input number
 to an @xexpr forest rendering, a processing function, and the next allowable
 input number.

 (Actually, @racket[formlet/c] is a macro which avoids using @racket[dynamic->*]
 when the number of range contracts for the processing function is known at compile time.)

          "Fixed support for multiple return values."]
}

@defthing[formlet*/c contract?]{
  Similar to the contracts created by @racket[formlet/c], but uses @racket[any]
  to avoid checking the results (or even specifying the number of results)
  of the processing function.

                [g (formlet/c any/c ...)])
         (formlet/c any/c ...)]{
 Constructs a @tech{formlet} with a rendering equal to the concatenation of the renderings of @tech{formlet}s @racket[f] and @racket[g];
 a processing stage that applies @racket[g]'s processing results to @racket[f]'s processing result.

  identity procedure as the processing step.
}

@defproc[(xml [r xexpr/c])
         (formlet/c procedure?)]{
  Equivalent to @racket[(xml-forest (list r))].
}

@defproc[(text [r string?])
         (formlet/c procedure?)]{
  Equivalent to @racket[(xml r)].
}

@defproc[(tag-xexpr [tag symbol?]
                    [attrs (listof (list/c symbol? string?))]
                    [inner (formlet/c any/c)])
         (formlet/c any/c)]{
  Constructs a @tech{formlet} with the rendering @racket[(list (list*
  tag attrs inner-rendering))] where @racket[inner-rendering] is the
  rendering of @racket[inner] and the processing stage identical to
  @racket[inner].

         xexpr-forest/c]{

                          [r request?])
         (values any/c ...)]{
  Runs the processing stage of @racket[f] on the bindings in @racket[r].

@section{Formlets and Stateless Servlets}
@defmodule[#:multi (web-server/formlets/stateless
                    web-server/formlets/unsafe)]

A few additional considerations apply when using formlets with 
stateless @(hash-lang) @racketmodname[web-server] servlets.

First of all, continuations captured in your servlet cannot
be serialized if they close over non-serializable data-structures.
There are some generally-applicable ways to avoid having a data structure
be part of the closure: for example, if you define all of your formlets
as module-level variables, they will never be part of closures and will not
need to be serialized.
However, sometimes it can be useful to create formlets dynamically.
To support this, all of the combinators documented above produce
formlets that are serializable (as long as they contain only serializable values).
This is not guaranteed to be true of third-party formlets.

@margin-note{One potential pitfall for formlets and serialization is
@racket[pure]. Note that @racket[(serialize (pure +))] will @bold{fail},
because @racket[+] is not serializable. To avoid this, you can
write @racket[(pure (λ args (apply + args)))] (in @(hash-lang) @racketmodname[web-server],
where anonymous procedures are serializable, or using
@racketmodname[web-server/lang/serial-lambda]).
}

Secondly, stateless @(hash-lang) @racketmodname[web-server] servlets are based on
different web interaction primitives than stateful servlets, so the version of
@racket[send/formlet] from @racketmodname[web-server/formlets] will not work.
Instead, the library @racketmodname[web-server/formlets/stateless] provides
the same API as @racketmodname[web-server/formlets], but with a version of
@racket[send/formlet] for use in stateless servlets.
(Using @racketmodname[web-server/formlets/stateless] also provides all of the
bindings from @racketmodname[web-server/formlets/lib], whereas 
@racketmodname[web-server/formlets] provides only some of them.)
Alternatively, you can use the low-level @racket[formlet-process] and
@racket[formlet-display] procedures directly.

Another issue concerns capturing continuations within the processing
stage of a formlet. Recall that serializable continuations in 
@(hash-lang) @racketmodname[web-server] can only be captured from within
transformed contexts. The contract system is not transformed, so
the contracts on this library prevent capturing continuations
during the processing stage of formlets.
In most cases, the best solution is simply to avoid using
continuation-capturing operations during a formlet's processing stage.
Instead, have the processing stage return a value, and interact with
the user based on that value in code outside of the formlet.
Alternatively, you can use generally-applicable approaches for capturing
continuations from untransformed contexts, such as
@racketmodname[web-server/lang/native].
However, if neither of those approaches are satisfactory, the
library @racketmodname[web-server/formlets/unsafe] provides the same API as
@racketmodname[web-server/formlets/stateless], but @italic{without enforcing
 contracts.} As the name implies, using @racketmodname[web-server/formlets/unsafe]
may produce inscrutable error messages and other unpleasant effects of programming
without contracts: you have been warned.
