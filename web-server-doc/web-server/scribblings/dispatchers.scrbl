@title[#:tag "dispatchers"
       #:style 'toc]{Dispatchers}

Since the @web-server is really just a particular configuration of a
dispatching server, there are several dispatchers that are defined
to support the @|web-server|. Other dispatching servers may find these useful. In particular, if you want
a peculiar processing pipeline for your @web-server installation, refer to this
documentation.

@section[#:tag "dispatch"]{General}
@(require (for-label web-server/dispatchers/dispatch))

@defmodule[web-server/dispatchers/dispatch]{

This module provides a few functions for dispatchers in general.

@defthing[dispatcher/c contract?]{
 Equivalent to @racket[(connection? request? . -> . any)].

  @history[#:changed "1.3"
           @elem{Weakened the range contract to allow @racket[any]}]
}

@defproc[(dispatcher-interface-version/c (any any/c)) boolean?]{
 Equivalent to @racket[(symbols 'v1)]
}

@defstruct[exn:dispatcher ()]{
 An exception thrown to indicate that a dispatcher does not apply to a particular
 request.
}

@defproc[(next-dispatcher) any]{
 Raises a @racket[exn:dispatcher]
}

As the @racket[dispatcher/c] contract suggests, a dispatcher is a function that takes a connection
and request object and does something to them. Mostly likely it will generate
some response and output it on the connection, but it may do something
different. For example, it may apply some test to the request object, perhaps
checking for a valid source IP address, and error if the test is not passed, and call @racket[next-dispatcher]
otherwise.

Consider the following example dispatcher, that captures the essence of URL rewriting:
@racketblock[
 (code:comment "(url? -> url?) dispatcher/c -> dispatcher/c")
 (lambda (rule inner)
   (lambda (conn req)
     (code:comment "Call the inner dispatcher...")
     (inner conn
            (code:comment "with a new request object...")
            (struct-copy request req
                         (code:comment "with a new URL!")
                         [request-uri (rule (request-uri req))]))))
]

}

@; ------------------------------------------------------------
@section[#:tag "filesystem-map"]{Mapping URLs to Paths}
@(require (for-label web-server/dispatchers/filesystem-map))

@defmodule[web-server/dispatchers/filesystem-map]{

This module provides a means of mapping
URLs to paths on the filesystem.

@defthing[url->path/c contract?]{
 This contract is equivalent to @racket[((url?) . ->* . (path? (listof path-piece?)))].
 The returned @racket[path?] is the path on disk. The list is the list of
 path elements that correspond to the path of the URL.}

@defproc[(make-url->path (base path-string?))
         url->path/c]{
 The @racket[url->path/c] returned by this procedure considers the root
 URL to be @racket[base]. It ensures that @racket[".."]s in the URL
 do not escape the @racket[base] and removes them silently otherwise.}

@defproc[(make-url->valid-path (url->path url->path/c))
         url->path/c]{
 Runs the underlying @racket[url->path], but only returns if the path
 refers to a file that actually exists. If it is does not, then the suffix
 elements of the URL are removed until a file is found. If this never occurs,
 then an error is thrown.

 This is primarily useful for dispatchers that allow path information after
 the name of a service to be used for data, but where the service is represented
 by a file. The most prominent example is obviously servlets.}

@defproc[(filter-url->path [regex regexp?]
                                 [url->path url->path/c])
         url->path/c]{
 Runs the underlying @racket[url->path] but will only return if the
 path, when considered as a string, matches the @racket[regex]. This is
 useful to disallow strange files, like GIFs, from being considered
 servlets when using the servlet dispatchers. It will return a
 @racket[exn:fail:filesystem:exists?] exception if the path does not
 match.
}

@defproc[(make (dispatcher dispatcher/c) ...)
         dispatcher/c]{
 Invokes each @racket[dispatcher], invoking the next if the first
 calls @racket[next-dispatcher]. If no @racket[dispatcher] applies,
 then it calls @racket[next-dispatcher] itself.
}}

@a-dispatcher[web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-filter
              @elem{defines a dispatcher constructor

 a string, matches @racket[regex]. Otherwise, calls @racket[next-dispatcher].
}}

@section[#:tag "dispatch-method"]{Filtering Requests by Method}

@defproc[(make (method (or/c symbol? (listof symbol?))) (inner dispatcher/c))
         dispatcher/c]{
 Calls @racket[inner] if the method of the request, converted to
 a string, case-insensitively matches @racket[method] (if method is a symbol, or, if a list, one of the elements of @racket[method]). Otherwise, calls @racket[next-dispatcher].
}}

@section[#:tag "dispatch-pathprocedure"]{Procedure Invocation upon Request}
@a-dispatcher[web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-pathprocedure
              @elem{defines a dispatcher constructor

         dispatcher/c]{
 Checks if the request URL path as a string is equal to @racket[path]

a URL that refreshes the password file, servlet cache, etc.}

 Formats a request by:

     (uri ,(url->string (request-uri req)))
     (time ,(current-seconds))))
 ]}

@defthing[apache-default-format format-req/c]{

 Formats a request like Apache's default. However, Apache's default
 includes information about the response to a request, which this
 function does not have access to, so it defaults the last two fields
 to @racket[200] and @racket[512].

}

@defthing[log-format/c contract?]{

 Logs requests to @racket[log-path], which can be either a filepath or an @racket[output-port?],

@defthing[denied?/c contract?]{

  A dispatcher that checks if the request is denied based on
  @racket[denied?]. If so, then @racket[authentication-responder] is
  called with a @racket[header] that requests credentials. If not, then
  @racket[next-dispatcher] is invoked.
}

@defthing[authorized?/c contract?]{
 Equivalent to
 @racket[(string? (or/c false/c bytes?) (or/c false/c bytes?) . -> . (or/c false/c string?))].
 The input is the URI as a string and the username and passwords as
 bytes.  The return is the authentication realm as a string if the user
 is not authorized and @racket[#f] if the request @emph{is} authorized.
}

@defproc[(make-basic-denied?/path [authorized? authorized?/c])

         (values (-> void)
                 authorized?/c)]{
 Creates an authorization procedure based on the given password
 file. The first returned value is a procedure that refreshes the
 password cache used by the authorization procedure.

 @racket[password-file] is parsed as:

 Extracts a host from the URL requested, or the Host HTTP header,

               [#:indices indices (listof string?) (list "index.html" "index.htm")])
         dispatcher/c]{
 Uses @racket[url->path] to extract a path from the URL in the request
 object. If this path does not exist, then the dispatcher does not apply and
 @racket[next-dispatcher] is invoked.
 If the path is a directory, then the @racket[indices] are checked in order
 for an index file to serve. In that case, or in the case of a path that is
 a file already, @racket[path->mime-type] is consulted for the MIME
 Type of the path. The file is then
 streamed out the connection object.

 This dispatcher supports HTTP Range GET requests and HEAD
 requests. If the request's method is neither HEAD nor GET,
 @racket[next-dispatcher] will be called.

 If the path works out to something on disk (either as a
 file, or, if the path refers to directory, one of the
 specified @racket[indices] files in that directory), it
 needs to be readable by the process that is running the web
 server. Existing but unreadable files are handled as
 non-existing files.}

         dispatcher/c]{
 Returns a dispatcher that defers to @racket[inner] for work, but will forward a maximum of @racket[limit] requests concurrently.

 If there are no additional spaces inside the limit and a new request is received, the @racket[over-limit] option determines what is done.
 The default (@racket['block]) causes the new request to block until an old request is finished being handled.
 If @racket[over-limit] is @racket['kill-new], then the new request handler is killed---a form of load-shedding.
 If @racket[over-limit] is @racket['kill-old], then the oldest request handler is killed---prioritizing new connections over old.
 (This setting is a little dangerous because requests might never finish if there is constant load.)
