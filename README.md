This is the main repository for the Racket web-server package.

It is a simple yet powerful continuation-based web server, but you can use it without continuations if you like!
Check the [documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/) for a quick start guide.
There is also a [good tutorial](https://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/) on making a blog written by [Danny Yoo](https://github.com/dyoo) and [Jay McCarthy](https://github.com/jeapostrophe).
